# JD-Plays Mod Pack


A mod pack for setting up new JD-Plays community maps.

- When enabled it sets other mod's setting's defaults to JD values. So good for when making a new map and adding these mods so they get their default values. By setting default values it still allows them to be overridden on a per map basis.
- Has required and optional mods that are commonly used in Community Maps.
- It makes camp-fires from the Fire Place mod just be used by streamer integration.
