# JD-Plays Mod Pack


A mod pack for setting up new JD-Plays community maps.

- When enabled it sets other mod's setting's defaults to JD values. So good for when making a new map and adding these mods so they get their default values.
- It makes camp-fires from the Fire Place mod just be used by streamer integration.
